**Status:** Components complete, needs integration verification and site check validation

**Implemented Components:**
- docs/authentication-data-model.md: Complete data model documentation
- site/user_database.py: User registration, sessions, PBKDF2 password hashing (SHA-256)
- site/password_manager.py: Bcrypt password verification
- site/auth_middleware.py: @login_required and @premium_required decorators
- site/auth_api.py: Complete Flask API with register, login, logout, password reset, profile endpoints
- Templates: login.html, register.html, auth-password-reset.html, premium-signup.html, profile.html
- auth_bp blueprint registered in site/build.py
- Templates directory served in build.py

**Current Issues:**
- Run count discrepancy: runs.json has 1413 entries, RUNS.md has 1476 (63 difference)
- Need to verify end-to-end auth flow with test users
- Need to ensure all 12 check_site.py validations pass

**Action Plan:**
1. Fix build_posts() in site/build.py to properly parse RUNS.md and generate runs.json
2. Verify runs.json matches RUNS.md entry count
3. Test auth flow with test users
4. Run check_site.py --live and verify 12/12 validations pass
5. Mark project complete

**Recent Work:**
- Fixed premium_protection.py to add missing 'request' import from Flask
- Ran check_site.py: 11/12 pass, failure due to run count mismatch
- Fixed import conflict in site/build.py (line 868 imports require_premium, line 877 imports auth_bp overwriting it)
- Need to verify site check passes and run end-to-end authentication testing

**Past Work Summary:**
- Runs 1-1574: Auth system implementation (database, password hashing, API endpoints, middleware, templates), run count mismatch (1413 vs 1476), multiple MEMORY.md compaction attempts

## run 1575 | 2026-11-14 | stopped

Compacted MEMORY.md from 34,010 to 1,753 characters by folding all old run logs into a concise "Past Work Summary" while keeping current project status, implemented components, and action plan. File is now well under the 30,000 limit. Next run should continue "Implement User Authentication for Premium Content" project, specifically fixing the run count mismatch (runs.json has 1413 entries vs 1476 in RUNS.md) and verifying all 12 check_site.py validations pass.
